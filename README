This is a simple class for creating a sprite object for use in a pygame project.
This class supports transparency, animations, and movement on a screen.
Give a sprite instance a screen, image file, position and resolution (based on the image file).
Animations must be added separately, with an animation name, number of frames, and duration of each frame. Animations can then be fed to sprites for use.
In this way, ALL animation frames for any single sprite object can be loaded in with a single png file. The default alpha value is purple (255, 0, 255).
The limitations are that each frame is restricted to being the same size, and running for the same duration of time.

The sprite class has an update() method, which should be run every tick of game time.
